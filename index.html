    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
        Im a developer trying to make a nice looking portfolio page.

        <!-- These two make 2 new lines -->
        <br><br>

        I love learning new skills, this is why I started to learn <strong>3D Modeling</strong>, programming in <strong>C#</strong>, <strong>C++</strong>,
        <strong>PHP</strong>, <strong>JS</strong>, <strong>Python</strong> and some other stuff too. Im also experienced with managing and handling
        <strong>Linux</strong>. Thanks to this skill I was able to manage Linux Servers. I started tinkering with the Windows Batch Scripting Language at the
        age of about 12, and started to learn on how to make basic websites with <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> in 2017 at the age of about 14.
        <br><br>

        It was a fun time learning these skills, and I've kept it up and are still practising programming and to this day there is still a lot to learn. Like
        mentioned above, I also started learning <strong class="orange">3D Modeling</strong>  and <strong class="orange">Animating</strong> because I want to be
        able to make <strong class="orange">short cinematic films</strong> in the future.

    <h2>Strenghs and Weaks</h2>
    <h3>Strenghs</h3>
    <p>
        Im pretty good at <strong class="green">problem solving</strong> and if I really want something I can get it done. I also have a very
        <strong class="green">forgiving heart</strong> which has some pro's and con's on its own but thats another topic. Other than that Im a
        pretty <strong class="green">lovely</strong> person which a very dark humor. I also tend to be <strong class="green">clingy</strong> sometimes.
        All in one im a very <strong class="green">chill</strong> and <strong class="green">calm</strong> person.
    </p><br><br>

    <h3>Weaks</h3>
    <p>
        My biggest problem is that I get <strong class="red">jealous</strong> very easily but I learned the hard way and ever since then im very careful. Since im pretty
        <strong class="red">introverted</strong> Im <strong class="red">socially</strong> a bit <strong class="red">weak</strong> too, but its getting a lot better
        and already is a lot better than in the past.
